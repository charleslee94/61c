CS61C Spring 2014 Project 1 Task A Writeup

1. For each of the test image provided in advanced_tests/, which images are not recognized correctly?
 Sans_serif_5, serif_5, and serif_8 are not recognized correctly. The other files provided in advanced_tests/ are all recognized correctly.






2. For each test image listed in the previous question, What is the difference in "digit distances" between the recognized digit and the digit it is supposed to be (e.g. if a digit 3 is recognized as 8, and 3 has a "digit distance" of 10 while 8 has a "digit distance" of 20, then difference in distances is 20 - 10 = 10).
for sans_serif_5: 8969982
for serif_8: 4860691
for serif_5: 7957904







3. Give a one to two sentence explanation on why you think the images mentioned above are recognized incorrectly.
The combination of a change in font and translation of the image resulted in an incorrect reading. 3 looks similar enough to an 8 to be mistaken by the reading. The sans_serif 5 also looks similar enough to a 6 that such a drastic change in font resulted in a faulty recognization.
